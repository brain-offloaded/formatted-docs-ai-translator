# Code Editing Rules

- Always review your progress periodically while working on tasks. Especially do this after completing each detail task, unit of task, or subtask.
  1. Review the changes in your code editor or IDE to ensure they meet the project's coding standards.
    - Check for any recent edits that may have been made to the files you are working on.
    - Ensure that all changes are intentional and necessary.
  2. Run `yarn build` to ensure the project is built correctly.
    - If there are any build errors, fix them before proceeding.
    - Do this loop until the build is successful.
  3. Use `yarn lint` to check for any linting errors.
    - If there are linting errors, fix them before committing.
    - Do this loop until there are no linting errors.
  4. Repeat the above steps until all checks pass and the code is ready for review.
